# Schooling and fertility

Here we are analyzing this dataset from the World Bank on gender and
inequality:

* [https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics](https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics)

You can download the data yourself as a zip file [from that site](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/Gender_Stats_csv.zip), but to
make your life a little easier, I’ve make a copy of the extracted data file, available via this link.

* [Gender_StatsData.csv](https://matthew-brett.github.io/les-pilot/_downloads/Gender_StatsData.csv)

That's the link I'm using below.

```{python}
# Import Pandas with its usual short name
import pandas as pd
```

Load the Comma Separated Value text file into Pandas as a data frame:

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('https://matthew-brett.github.io/les-pilot/_downloads/Gender_StatsData.csv')
```

This is a slightly clumsy-looking data frame, because it has years for
columns, and variables for rows, where there are 630 variables for each
country.  So there are 630 rows \* the number of countries.  To investigate,
we first look at the column names:

```{python}
df.columns
```

Next we look at the data frame itself:

```{python}
df
```

There are lots of countries here, so to start, let’s look at the variables for
the UK.

We get the UK country code from [http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/ctycodes.htm](http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/ctycodes.htm).
The code is `GBR`.

```{python}
# We select only the UK rows
gb = df[df['Country Code'] == 'GBR']
gb
```

Pandas truncates the output to only show a certain number of rows, and only a
certain length for the text fields.  To investigate further, you can increase
these limits to see all 630 rows for the UK, and more of the text for the text
fields:

```{python}
# See more of the text, more rows in the displayed output
pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 80
pd.options.display.max_rows = 700
```

If you are working in the Notebook, you will now see all of the rows and the
whole text field with the variable description.

```{python}
# This will be different from above when working in the Notebook
gb
```

We need to reduce the data.  Let us start by trying to reduce the number of missing values.  Here are the number of valid observations for some recent years:

```{python}
for year in range(2008, 2018):
    print(year, df[str(year)].count())
```

```{python}
recent = df[[str(year) for year in range(2012, 2017)]]
recent.columns
```

Let's try taking the average of 2012 through 2016. This automatically discards missing (NA) values.

```{python}
recent_mean = recent.mean(axis=1)
recent_mean.count()
```

We only want the first four columns of the data frame - the rest are year
values, many of which are missing.  Drop the columns after the fourth, and
then add back the 2012 through 2016 data.

```{python}
thin_df = df[['Country Name', 'Indicator Name']].copy()
thin_df['recent_mean'] = recent_mean.copy()
thin_df
```

This data frame is still a mess, with a new row for each variable.  We can
solve this using the Pandas
[pivot](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html) function
to push the rows up into columns, thus:

```{python}
pivoted = thin_df.pivot(index='Country Name',
                   columns='Indicator Name',
                   values='recent_mean')
pivoted
```

Now we have 630 columns, one per variable, and 263 rows, one per country.

```{python}
pivoted.shape
```

Many of these columns have a lot of missing values.  Which columns have at least 220 non-missing values?

```{python}
cols_ok = [name for name in pivoted.columns if pivoted[name].count() > 220]
[(name, pivoted[name].count()) for name in cols_ok]
```

We will use some of these columns.  The current column names are the whole description.  These are hard to use.  Here's a function to do a first pass in stripping the description down into something more like a variable name.

```{python}
def col_proc(cname):
    if '(' in cname:  # Drop phrase in parentheses
        cname = cname[:cname.index('(')]
    return '_'.join(word.lower()[:3] for word in cname.split())
```

Print out the long description and the first-pass variable name the function returns:

```{python}
[(name, col_proc(name)) for name in cols_ok]
```

After copy-pasting this output into a text editor, and reflecting for a bit, these variables seem useful.  I've hand-edited the variable names to make them a bit clearer:


```{python}
# (Description, Variable name) pairs.
# I've edited the Variable name by hand in a text editor.
renamers = [   
    ('Fertility rate, total (births per woman)', 'fert_rate'),
    ('GDP (current US$)', 'gdp'),
    ('Health expenditure per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $)', 
     'health_exp_per_cap'),
    ('Health expenditure, public (% of GDP)', 'health_exp_pub'),
    ('Primary education, pupils (% female)', 'prim_ed_girls'),
    ('Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)',
     'mat_mort_ratio'),
    ('Population, total', 'population')
]
```

Create a new, much smaller data frame, using these columns.  Rename the columns with the new names.

```{python}
gender_stats = pivoted[[name for (name, rename) in renamers]]
gender_stats.columns = [rename for (name, rename) in renamers]
gender_stats
```

Write the resulting data frame out to CSV.

```{python}
gender_stats.index.names = ['country']
gender_stats.to_csv('gender_stats.csv')
```

```{python}
gender_stats
```

We should write a data dictionary too.  We will have to backslash escape dollars for the Markdown output.

```{python}
with open('gender_stats_data_dict.md', 'wt') as fobj:
    fobj.write('# Gender statistics data dictionary\n\n')
    for name, rename in renamers:
        name = name.replace('$', '\$')  # For Markdown
        fobj.write(f'* `{rename}`: {name}.\n')
```
