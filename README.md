# R from scratch

A beginners introduction to R, for the second year Bioscientists at the
University of Birmingham.

Some links I'm using:

* [Build
  overview](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/repositories/3865/branches/master)
* [Editor](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/edit/v2/repositories/3865/branches/master)
* [R correctness tests](https://datacamp.github.io/testwhat/index.html)

Otherwise, I am doing web searches for "DataCamp" and various terms.  I've got
some good hits with searches on Github.
